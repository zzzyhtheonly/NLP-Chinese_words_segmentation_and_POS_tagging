Python source code files(can execute by python3):
	generateInputforOne.py : transfer raw data of one file into the formed data we need	
	generateDict.py : generate dictionary file dictionary.dic
	generateRaw.py : transfer raw data into raw Chinese article, generate file InputRaw.txt
	forward_segmentation.py : forward segmentation, generate file forward.txt
	backward_segmentation.py : backward segmentation, generate file backward.txt
	addFeatureforTest.py : add features for InputTest.pos, generate file output_test.feature
	addFeature.py  : add features for InputTraining.pos, generate file output.feature
	addPOS.py  : add POS tags for InputTest.pos, generate file output.pos
	SEGscore.py : compare the baseline segmentation and output segmentation, give the correctness and put the result into file result.res
	POSscore.py : compare the baseline and output with pos tags, give the correctness and put the result into file result.res
	divideInto70wordsDoc.py : useless in this project, but for personal tests
	
Shell scripts(can execute by /bin/bash, "./" command in linux machines):
	generate_ALL_input.sh : generate all input files we need, including InputTraining.pos, dictionary.dic, InputTest.pos, Baseline.pos, and InputRaw.txt
	run.sh : execute the project automatically, including generating inputs, segmentation, HMM and MEMM adding tags and giving the results
	
Files generated by programs:
	Baseline.pos : use as baseline of words with pos tags for POSscore.py
	dictionary.dic : use as dictionary for segmentation.py
	Baseline.seg : use as baseline of segmentation test for SEGscore.py
	InputRaw.txt : use as raw Chinese article for segmentation.py
	InputTest.pos : use as untagged input for pos addPOS.py and addFeatureforTest.py
	InputTraining.pos : use as training data of words with pos tags for addPOS.py and addFeature.py
	forward.txt : forward segmentation generated by segmentation.py
	backward.txt : backward segmentation generated by segmentation.py
	output.pos : pos generated by addPOS.py 
	output.feature : features generated by addFeature.py
	output_test.feature : features generated by addFeatureforTest.py
	result.res: the results of forward and backward segmentation correctness and pos tags correctness of HMM

Data(tar):
	posdata.tar : raw data collected from internet of chinese words with pos tags
	trainingdata.tar : about 80% raw data in posdata using for training
	testdata.tar : about 20% raw data in posdata using for test
